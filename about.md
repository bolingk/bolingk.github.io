<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I spend my days providing technical customer service for property management firms leveraging Yardi software solutions. I work heavily in SQL Server to develop custom data fixes, and implementing host-to-host banking integrations.</p>

<p>My background is a diverse one, ranging from military service, to undergraduate studies in physics, and later, Fortune 300 experience working for a major agricultural equipment manufactureer in roles varying from sales operations to software and data project managment.</p>

<p>More recently I spent the 2018 hiking season trekking north along the East Coast of the United States following the Appalachian Trail, fulfilling a long time dream. Following my hike, I settled down with Yardi Systems in Roswell, GA.</p>

<p>I’m constantly learning web technologies and other development related topics, currently working on my Masters of Science in Computer Science at Kennesaw State University. I’m skilled in many areas of software development. Some of my skills include:</p>
